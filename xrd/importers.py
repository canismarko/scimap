    beamline 34-ID-E. The data should be taken in a rectangle.

    Arguments
    ---------

    - directory : Directory where to look for results. It should
    contain .chi files that are q or 2-theta and intensity data."

    - wavelength : Wavelength of x-ray used, in angstroms.

    - shape : 2-tuple for number of scanning loci in each
      direction. The first value is the slow axis and the second is
      the fast axis.

    - step_size : Number indicating how far away each locus is from
      every other. Best practice is to include units directly by using
      the `units` package.

    - hdf_filename : HDF File used to store computed results. If
      omitted or None, the `directory` basename is used

    - hdf_groupname : String to use for the hdf group of this
      dataset. If omitted or None, the `directory` basename is
      used. Raises an exception if the group already exists in the HDF
      file.
